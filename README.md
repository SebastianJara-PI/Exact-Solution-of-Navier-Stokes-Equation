# Exact-Solution-of-Navier-Stokes-Equation

This repository implements **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve a collection of **exact-solution benchmark problems** for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.

The benchmarks are taken from **Chapter 3** of the book: **Michel O. Deville — _An Introduction to the Mechanics of Incompressible Fluids_**
